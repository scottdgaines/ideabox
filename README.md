## Project Context

Ideabox was built by Lee Young, Matthew Press, and Scott Gaines from a previously-set comp provided by the [Turing School of Software and Design](https://turing.edu/). At the time of this project's assignment and completion, we had been coding for approximately one month.

Goals for this project included:
- Gain an understanding of how to write clean HTML and CSS to match a provided comp
- Understand what it looks like to have a separate data model (using a class) and DOM model
- Incorporate & iterate over arrays in order to filter what is being displayed
- Craft code with clean style, using small functions that show trends toward DRYness and SRP

## Installation Steps

1. Fork and clone this repo to your local machine.
2. Run 'cd ideabox' in the command line to move into the root directory.
3. Run 'open index.html' in the command line to open the application in your browser.

## Using the App

1. Enter a title for your idea in the Title field.
2. Enter a description of your idea in the Body field.
3. Click the Save button to save your idea and display it to the screen.

## Dev Reflections and Notes

The project consisted of four iterations plus optional extensions. As a team, we successfully completed the first three iterations in full, including a full refactoring session. The original comp called for a few features that are not included in our final submission (eg: menu in the nav bar, a "Show Saved Ideas" button, and a comment button at the bottom of the cards). We included these in the initial version of the app, but in the interest of the user, removed them when refactoring as their functionality was not built out.

### Wins
- Smooth and productive group dynamics
- Efficient workflow
